# Oríkì Cultural Guidelines

This document provides cultural guidance for generating Oríkì-inspired praise poetry.

## 1. Oríkì Aesthetic Elements

### Structural Foundations
- **Praise-naming**: Layered epithets ("The one who...", "She whose...", "He who walks...")
- **Anaphora**: Repetition of opening phrases for rhythm
- **Incremental intensification**: Each line builds on the previous
- **Percussive brevity**: Short, punchy phrases interspersed with longer elaborations

### Nature Metaphors (Safe to Use)
- **Animals**: Lion (courage), elephant (wisdom), leopard (stealth), eagle (vision)
- **Natural forces**: Thunder, river, mountain, wind, fire
- **Plants**: Iroko tree (endurance), palm tree (provision), baobab (ancient wisdom)
- **Celestial**: Sun, moon, stars as metaphors for guidance and illumination

### Tone
- Unapologetic celebration
- Identity affirmation
- Protective power
- Historical continuity

## 2. What to AVOID (Non-Negotiable)

**NEVER Invent:**
1. **Yoruba Personal Names** - Real names tied to actual families
2. **Clan Names (Orílẹ̀)** - Connected to real genealogies and land rights
3. **Place-Based Lineage Claims** - "From the hills of Ọ̀yọ́" etc.
4. **Òrìṣà Attributions** - "Ṣàngó walks with you" etc. (living religious tradition)
5. **Fabricated Totems or Sacred Objects**
6. **Invented Yoruba Proverbs**
7. **Fictional Spiritual Powers or Practices**

**NEVER:**
- Exoticize Yoruba culture as mysterious mysticism
- Drop in Yoruba words randomly for "flavor"
- Call generated content "traditional Oríkì" or "authentic"
- Fail to make clear this is *inspired by* the tradition

## 3. Safe Creative Territory

**Structural Elements (Always OK):**
- Praise-naming format
- Anaphoric repetition
- Rhythmic call-and-response patterns
- Incremental intensification
- Universal nature metaphors

**Content Sources (Only draw from):**
- User's PROVIDED name (any cultural origin)
- User's STATED heritage
- User's CONFIRMED accomplishments
- User's EXPRESSED values and aspirations
- Universal human experiences

## 5. Cultural Disclaimer (Display to Users)

**About Yoruba-Inspired Praise Poetry**

The poetry you receive is *inspired by* the Yoruba tradition of Oríkì—a centuries-old form of praise poetry that celebrates identity, lineage, and character through rhythmic, metaphor-rich verse.

**What This Is:**
This app uses the *aesthetic structure* of Oríkì (praise-naming, nature metaphors, rhythmic repetition) to celebrate *your* unique heritage and accomplishments.

**What This Is NOT:**
- Not traditional Yoruba Oríkì performed by a skilled practitioner
- Not a claim of Yoruba ancestry unless you have shared that heritage
- Does not replace consultation with cultural knowledge-keepers

**Our Cultural Commitment:**
We will NEVER fabricate Yoruba names, clan identities, or spiritual relationships that are not part of your confirmed heritage. We celebrate Yoruba tradition by respecting its boundaries.
